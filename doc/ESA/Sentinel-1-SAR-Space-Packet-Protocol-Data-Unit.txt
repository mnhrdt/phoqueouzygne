Introduction

1.1

Scope

9 of 85

This document gives a comprehensive description of the Sentinel-1 Space Packet on packet layer level. It
describes the structure of the packets, provides the data formats and decoding algorithms for user data
decoding and gives a detailed description of the annotated SAR ancillary header data.
Electrical, mechanical or transmit channel coding characteristics are not part of this document. These can be
found in the electrical ICDs.

1.2

Overview

For packetized transmission of SAR data from the Instrument to the S/C platform the Space Packet Protocol
Standard [SD 01] is applied.
Each Space Packet generated by the Instrument contains the complete SAR data acquired in one PRI. The
standard limits the maximum packet size to (65536+6) octets but, due to decimation and BAQ compression of
SAR data in nominal operation the packet size will stay well below this limit.
The format of the Space Packet is described in section 3. In each packet a SAR ancillary data field is
included. The ancillary data provide the information how to interprete, decode and process the SAR radar
data in the packet. In addition, they provide information about Instrument status and configuration at the
moment of data acquisition (digitizing). General approach here is to provide appropriate information for ground
to support SAR image decoding and processing.
In section 4 the decoding algorithms are described to retrieve the SAR radar data from the packets to finally
get the usual complex radar data representation suitable to be fed into a ground image processor.
Typically, the acquired SAR data in a PRI is a radar echo received as a backscattered response of a radar
pulse transmitted some few PRIs before. But also other data are generated by the Instrument like calibration,
noise or test data.

1.3

Conventions and Definitions

1.3.1

Sequencing and Numbering of Parameters

The Space Packet data format is described as a sequence of octets.
The start position of a parameter or a data word within the sequence is defined by the “Octet Offset” and the
“Bit Offset” within the octet. The “Octet Offset” refers to the beginning of the overall Space Packet.
The N-BIT FIELD of a parameter or data word within the sequence may not be aligned to octet boundaries
and may have a size exceeding one octet.
The first bit of a N-BIT FIELD is defined to be “Bit 0” of the parameter or data word, the following bit is defined
to be “Bit 1” and so on up to “Bit N-1” (see Fig. 1-1).
For the interpretation of the binary code in the N-BIT FIELD the first bit (“Bit 0”) is the most significant bit
(msb), the last bit (“Bit N-1”) is the least significant bit (lsb).

Parameter Field Descriptions

The packet parameters are described with the key words shown in Table 1.3-1:
Key Word

Key Word Description

Description:

This field provides a brief description of the parameter

Performance:

This field defines the performance of the parameter, i.e. whether it has a “variable“ or
“constant“ value during the data take. If “variable“ is indicated this means the parameter may
be “variable“ but does not have to be.

Short Name:

This field defines the parameter name

Code Name:

This field defines the parameter code name (identified by the subscript “code”) which designates
the uncalibrated parameter code.

Code Properties: This field describes the parameter code in terms of:
Start Position
End Posiiton
Code Size
Data Type
Applicable Range of Code
Interpretation:

This field provides the interpretation of the parameter value in terms of its significance and
calibration to its physical value.

Dependencies:

This field describes the dependencies of the parameter with other parameters of the packet
header in order to:
show relations with other header parameters which have to be consistent
extract additional information by combining with other parameters

Note, that TFINE code and TCOAR code are registered (latched) times from Hardware clocks and
sampled with PRF rate. Hence, due to time sampling with PRF, the TFINE code transition to “0” may
not be observed and observed TFINE code value may already be >0 if a space packet indicates a
transition of TCOAR code .

Fixed Ancillary Data Field

The Fixed Auxiliary Data Service consists of 14 octets as shown in Table 3.2-3. The data in this service
remains invariant for the duration of the data-take.

Combined with the information of the Tx polarisation from the “Polarisation Field” (3.2.5.13.1.1) the
overall Tx/Rx polarisation of the actual packet can be identified.

Instrument Configuration ID

Description:

The Instrument Configuration ID is intended to support ground operations. It identifies in the
Space Packets the onboard configuration of the Instrument under which the Instrument has
operated and generated the data take. Knowledge of the configuration is a prerequisite for ground
processing of the data take raw data.
The Instrument configuration ID is a patchable Instrument parameter and is under control of
ground operations. It has to be patched together with an Instrument configuration change. An
Instrument configuration change is mainly induced by a change of the onboard Radar Data Base
(RDB), e.g. change of beam tables, ECC programs, etc...

received from the platform.
The S/C ancillary data are defined in Table 3.2-5 , Table 3.2-6 and Table 3.2-9.
The update rate of the data is up to 1Hz which is much lower than the PRF rate of Space Packet generation.
Hence, it is decided to sub-commutate the data in the Space Packet Secondary Header in portions of 16bit
data words. For identification of the sub-commutated data words a 16bit word index is referenced to each
word which is defined in Table 3.2-5 , Table 3.2-6 and Table 3.2-9.

TGU Temeprature (7 bit)

Table 3.2-10: TGU Temperature Format
The temperature HKs are acquired at different times throughout the operation. In detail, in a 16s period the
SES acquires sequentially the temperature HKs of 14 Tiles and the temperature HK of the TGU,
approximately, one HK value per second.
Temperature HK acquisition and the updating of their corresponding values in the Ancillary Data field of the
SAR header cannot be performed synchronously by the SES. Updating of the Ancillary Data in the SAR
header is coupled to the reception of an Attitude Data set from the platform (received with 1 Hz rate).
Whereas, acquisition of Temperature HKs is coupled to a SES internal acquisition cycle.
Therefore, depending on the actual timing between these two events, it may happen that a temperature HK
value just acquired is a little bit too late for insertion into the actual update of the Ancillary Data (in this case
the HK Update Status in Table 3.2-11 will indicate no update). The temperature HK will then be updated
during the next update event (triggered by reception of the next Attitude Data set).
On the other hand, it may happen that two temperature HK values will be updated at the same time during an
update of the Ancillary Data.
In any case, during a 16s interval all Tile ‘n’ and TGU temperature HKs will be updated in the SAR headers.
The Temperature HK Update Status in Table 3.2-11 identifies the temperature HK values (of Tile ‘n’ or TGU)
which have been acquired and updated in the latest update of the Ancillary Data.

3.2.3.1

Sub-commutated Ancillary Data Word Index

Description:

The Sub-commutated Ancillary Data Word Index is a rotating index which identifies the actual
16bit data word (see Table 3.2-5 and Table 3.2-6 and Table 3.2-9) in the sub-commutation frame
of the Service field.
A combined PVT/Attitude/Temperature HK data set consists of 64 data words which are
subcommutated in a sequence of SAR packet headers in the sequence from 1 to 64 with one
word per packet header. To each word the corresponding word index (1 to 64) is assigned in the
packet header which identifies the significance of the data word.
A complete and consistent set of PVT, Attitude or Temperature KK data is always
represented by a contiguous sequence of the word indices in the relevant data set, i.e. 1 to
22 for PVT data, 23 to 41 for Attitude data and 42 to 64 for Temperature HK data (note also,
that PVT and Attitude data sets have their own time stamps).
A word index value equal "0" will indicate invalidity of the inserted data word. A new PVT/Attitude
data set is received from the platform each second. During the short time of downloading of a new
data set to RxM the insertion of the old data into the header stops and the word index as well as
the data word are set to value "0". This indicates that there are no PVT/Attitude/Temperature data
available in the header. When the download of the new data set is completed, insertion into packet
headers restarts with the new PVT/Attitude/Temperature data at index=1.

3.2.4.1

Space Packet Count

Description:

In nominal operation, the Space Packet Count represents the actual count of Space Packets
output by the Instrument from the beginning of the data take. It will be a continuous count and
supports simple checking for completeness of the number of Space Packets to be expected by
nominal SAR Measurement Mode execution.
Exception:
In anomaly cases that result from a failure to generate a SAR Data space packet caused by
RxM FIFO overflow caused by a data rate exceeding 640 Mbps
or Packet length overflow
or both
the counter will increment but not be transmitted because the output of failed Space Packets will
be suppressed by the SAR Instrument during the recovery. In such an anomaly case, the Space
Packet Count observed by the user in the received packets will not be continuous.
In this case the number of missing counts of the Mode PRI Count (see 3.2.4.2) indicates the exact
1

number of Space Packets lost during the anomaly condition .
The Instrument autonomously resumes nominal operation after the failure conditions.
Anomaly Detection:
An anomaly has occured if SPCT increments >1 between adjacent packets k-1 and k.
The number N of lost packets during the anomaly is:

N PRICTk PRICTk 1 1 with
PRICTk : the first packet after the anomaly
PRICTk 1 : the last packet before the anomaly

Dependencies:

The number of missing counts in the Space Packet Count may be ambiguous due to the complexity of the internal

recovery process. Therefore, the number of missing Mode PRI counts shall be used as a precise indicator of missing
packets.

3.2.4.2

Mode PRI Count

Description:

The PRI Count represents the actual count of PRIs generated by the Instrument from the
beginning of the data take (ECC execution).
In the series of down-linked space packets the PRI Count may appear as a broken count between
downlinked packets. Such a broken PRI Count is an indicator that space packet generation has
been suppressed in the Instrument for a number of PRIs.
During nominal operation suppression of space packet generation is a common means during a
data take to avoid generation of useless packets which would otherwise burden data storage and
downlink budgets.
Examples for suppression of useless packets are e.g. during PRIs:
for warmup or stabilisation
to fade out any undesired signals from travelling Tx pulses and their echoes before performing a
noise measurement
Example:

SPCT
PRICT

s+2

s+3

s+4

s+5

s+6

p

p+1

p+2

p+16

p+17

p+18

p+19

Between Space Packets (s+2) and (s+3) there is a gap of 13 PRIs for which no Space Packets
have been recorded.
Each SAR mode operation starts with a systematic 2 PRI delay wrt. the start of the ECC program
execution. This means the PRI Count is systematically offset by 2 counts from the beginning (i.e.
the first PRI in the first ECC program entry will have assigned the Mode PRI Count = 2).

Interpretation:

PRICTcode

PRICT code is a count incremented by “1” for each PRI of the data take. It may be a broken count in
the stream of recorded Space Packets.
32

PRICT code wraps to “0” after 2 -1.
In the first generated space packet of the data take PRICT code starts with a value >0 since TxM
gain stabilisation and optional Frontend warm-up take place in the very beginning of ECC
execution for a number of PRIs with suppression of space packet generation.
Dependencies:

PRICT code of the first space packet of a data take (i.e. the PRICT code offset in first space packet)
depends on ECC code and on optional Frontend warm-up. Occurence of Frontend warm-up is not
flagged in the space packet annotated data, so, the PRICT code offset value can not be predicted.

Tx Pulse Ramp Rate

Description:

The Tx Pulse Ramp Rate indicates the linear FM rate at which the frequency changes over the
pulse duration.
The parameter value refers to the Tx pulse transmitted in the PRI when the SAR echo data of this
Space Packet have been sampled. Hence, due to the travel time from Tx pulse transmission to its
echo reception this parameter does not describe the originating Tx pulse of the SAR echo data of
this packet. The number of PRIs occuring from Tx pulse transmission to echo reception is defined
by parameter “Rank” (see 3.2.5.9). Hence, the Tx pulse parameter fitting to the (transmit)
properties of the SAR echo data in the actual packet can be found in the packet generated “Rank”
PRIs earlier (constant PRI assumed).

3.2.5.14.2 Tx Pulse Number
Description:

The Tx Pulse Number defines the address of the Tx Pulse selected in the Chirp Generator of the
SES.
The parameter value refers to the Tx pulse transmitted in the PRI when the SAR echo data of this
Space Packet have been sampled. Hence, due to the travel time from Tx pulse transmission to its
echo reception this parameter does not describe the originating Tx pulse of the SAR echo data of
this packet. The number of PRIs occuring from Tx pulse transmission to echo reception is defined
by parameter “Rank” (see 3.2.5.9). Hence, the Tx pulse parameter fitting to the (transmit)
properties of the SAR echo data in the actual packet can be found in the packet generated “Rank”
PRIs earlier (constant PRI assumed).

Interpretation:
The transition of SWAP code from “0” to “1” and vice versa indicates the potential updating of values
of one or more of the following parameters as a result of varying flight altitude round the orbit:
TXPNO
TXPL
TXPSF
TXPRR
RGDEC
SWL
SWST
PRI
RANK
The update occurs at the PRI that indicates the transition of SWAP.
Note 1: The SWAP flag indicates updating of parameters by the implemented Instrument update
mechanism, however, the updated parameter need not to change values.
Note 2: The Instrument implementation allows updating of all above parameters. However, the
actual measurement mode design has been optimised, so that only SWST and SWL are planned to
change values in a swath along the data take.
Note 3: The above parameters will also change due to the transitions between subswathes in
measurement modes in EW, IW and Wave . These changes are indicated by transitions of the
swath number SWATH (see 3.2.5.14.5).

1 I-part odd sample value
1 Q-Part even sample value
1 Q-part odd sample value
A complex radar sample is composed of one I-part and one Q-part sample value, respectively.
Consequently, the number of overall complex radar samples in the packet can be expressed as
the doubled value of the Number of Quads.

User Data Field

User Data Field Length

07.03.2014
56 of 85

The User Data Field may have a variable length LEN UD from PRI to PRI. The total length LEN SP of the
Space Packet is always a multiple of 4 octets.
LEN SP is composed of following contributions:
LEN SP

LEN PH

LEN SH

LEN UD

with
LEN SP : Total Length of Space Packet
LEN PH : Length of Primary Header (6 octets)

LEN SH : Length of Secondary Header (62 octets)
LEN UD : Variable Length of User Data Field

With the parameter “Packet Data Length” (PDL) in the Packet Primary Header (see Table 3.1-1) LEN UD can
be expressed as:
LEN UD

PDL

LEN SH

1

Since LEN PH

LEN SH

68 octets is a multiple of 4 octets, LEN UD also has to be a multiple of 4 octets to

ensure that the total Space Packet length LEN SP is a multiple of 4 octets.

3.3.2

User Data Format Types

The User Data Field contains one of four different format types of digitized data. The different format types are
the result of applying or bypassing specific digital processing functions in the Instrument digital Rx chain.
For each format type the ADC and SAR Packetisation functions are always active. They cannot be bypassed.
The term “digital processing functions” hereafter refers only to those functions that can be controlled for
bypassing.
Table 3.3-1 gives an overview of the possible data format types for the different types of acquired SAR data.
Table 3.3-2 lists the criteria for identification of the data format types in the User Data Field.
The detailed data formats together with the decoding algorithms are described in section 4.

Data Format Type A “Bypass”

This format type refers to digitized data with all digital processing functions in the Rx chain bypassed (see Fig.
3-1). Typically, this format type is output in Test Mode for test and debugging purposes.

Fig. 3-1: Active Functions for Bypass applied
3.3.2.2

Data Format Type B “Decimation Only”

This format type refers to digitized data with digital downconversion and decimation function applied (see Fig.
3-2). The data are digitally downconverted to baseband, low pass filtered and down-sampled accordingly.
Typically, this format type is output during the acquisisiton of calibration data.

Data Format Type C “Decimation + BAQ”

This format type refers to digitized data with all digital processing functions applied except the Entropy Coder
(see Fig. 3-3). This format type is not foreseen for typical nominal operation. It offers a fix BAQ quantisation
(not FDBAQ) with a fixed number of bits (according to BAQMOD) and without using the Entropy Coding and
hence, without the impact of a VBR (variable bit rate).

Fig. 3-3: Active Functions for “Decimation + BAQ” applied
3.3.2.4

Data Format Type D “Decimation + FDBAQ”

This format type refers to digitized data with all digital processing functions active (see Fig. 3-4). The FDBAQ
introduces a VBR compression. This format type is nominally used to output radar echo data.

3.3.3

User Data Organisation

The user data are originating from a number of ADC samples per PRI which are digitally processed in the
Instrument SES Rx chain in 4 data channels. Consequently, the user data are organised in the Space Packet
User Data Field as 4 individual data sections.
The data channels/sections are defined in Table 4-1:
Channel

Table 3.3-3: SAR Data Channel Definition

The terminology “even“ and “odd“ samples originates from the Hardware counting scheme of the Decimation Filter

which starts with the sample count=0 per PRI. So, e.g. the (demultiplexed) counts 0, 2,4,6,
samples or “even” channel and the (demultiplexed) counts 1,3,5,

represent the “even”

the “odd” samples or “odd” channel.

In section 4, for reasons of description, the sample enumeration is always starting with sample or code number=1 for each
channel.

The data sections are aligned to an integer number of 16 bit words. The sections may have different sizes in
case of FDBAQ and BAQ compression applied. E.g. in these cases some sections include extra control
information which are not contained in other sections. In addition, the FDBAQ compression function provides
a variable bit rate in each of the 4 data channels which leads to variable data volumes.
However, the number of SAR data samples in each data section will be the same.
The number of complex samples in the packet (sampled at the output of the Decimation Filter) is recorded as a
16bit parameter value NQ (Number of Quads) which is part of the Radar Samples Count Service (section
3.2.6). The number of complex radar samples in the packets is expressed in terms of so-called “Quads” where
a Quad is defined as:
1 Quad = 1 IE sample + 1 IO sample + 1 QE sample + 1 QO sample.
Consequently, the total number of complex radar samples equals 2*NQ (see also section 3.2.6).
Table 3.3-4 shows the overview of the sequence of the packetized data sections in the User Data Field.

Filler
(2 filler octets may be padded to make overall Space Packet length a multiple
of 4 octets)
Table 3.3-4: Overview of Packetisation in User Data Field
Each of the four data sections (IE, IO, QE, QO) contains NQ code elements which are packed as a number of
16bit words.
In case the NQ code elements of a section do not end at a 16 bit word boundary, filler bits will be padded in the
section up to the next word boundary.
For specific data format types specific sections also contain interleaved control information needed for the
decoding process. The details for this are described in the decoding section 4.
Finally, the total number of octets in the User Data Field must be divisible by 4. In case the cumulated number of
16bit words in the four data sections would become an odd number two filler octets will be attached at the end of
the User Data Field to make its length a multiple of 4 octets.

Principle of Decoding

The principle of decoding a compressed radar sample (I- or Q-component) is shown in Fig. 4-1.
For “Bypass” or “Decimation Only” user data (format types A and B) a specific radar sample value
reconstruction is not needed since the magnitude code ( M Code ) of the sample is identical with the magnitude
value ( M Value ).

Sample Alignment:
The sequence of the complex samples in the PRI rangeline will be obtained by arranging the sample values of
the 4 channels (IE,IO,QE,QO) in the following way:

complex _ SValue (2 j 1)
complex _ SValue (2 j )

IE _ SValue ( j ) ; QE _ SValue ( j )

Decoding of Data Format Type C (“Decimation + BAQ”)

The Data Format Type C is similar to that of as described in section 4.2. However, the SCodes are shorter
due to BAQ compression.
In addition, within the channel data sections, the BAQ encoded data are organised in BAQ blocks. Each BAQ
block has an 8-bit Threshold Index associated with it that is included in the QE channel data.
The arrangement of the format type C data is shown in Table 4.3-1.

Decoding of Data Format Type D (“Decimation + FDBAQ”)

The data of format type D is also structured in BAQ blocks as described in section 4.3.
However, the format type D data is Huffman encoded which introduces a non-predictable variable length
HCode in each BAQ block.
The arrangement of the format type D data is shown in Table 4.4-1. Values for HCode lengths and numbers
NW are given with “question marks” in the table because they are not predicitable and have to be determined
during the Huffman decoding process (see Fig. 4-6, Fig. 4-7, Fig. 4-8, Fig. 4-9, Fig. 4-10, Fig. 4-11).

Annexes

5.1

Support Tables for Computation of Number of Samples after Decimation

There are two look-up-tables needed to compute the number of complex samples after the decimation (or in
the Space Packet):
Table of values “D” which will be addressed by values “C” (see 3.2.5.12) and the Filter No. (see 3.2.5.4).
Table of values “FilterOutputOffset” which will be addressed by the Filter No.
The tables are shown in Table 5.1-1 and Table 5.1-2.
The Filter No. is equivalent to the header parameter “RGDEC code ” (see 3.2.5.4).

Table 5.2-1: Simple Reconstruction Parameter Values A, B

5.2.2

Tables for Normal Reconstruction Method

Compressed radar samples for which the Simple Reconstruction Scheme will not apply will be decompressed
by the Normal Reconstruction Scheme. The Normal Reconstruction scheme needs values of the Normalized
Reconstruction Levels (NRL) and the Sigma Factors (SF). These values are defined in the following
subsections.
5.2.2.1

Normalised Reconstruction Levels (NRL)

The selected NRL values represent the reconstructed sample values normalised to standard deviation = 1.
Up-scaling to the true standard deviation as measured in the SAR raw data will be performed with the Sigma
Factors in Table 5.2-3.
The NRL table is listed in Table 5.2-2 and will be addressed by the Magnitude Code of the quantised radar
sample and the BAQ mode (see 3.2.5.1)
in case of BAQ compression :
indicated by BAQMOD Code = 3 or 4 or 5 (indicating 3bit, 4bit or 5bit BAQ)

in case of FDBAQ compression (indicated by BAQMOD Code = 12 or 13 or 14):
by the BRC value which is part of the IE channel data of the User Data Field

Calibration Signal Acqusition Timing

The timing for acquisition of calibration signals is based on a fixed timing depending only on the Tx pulse
length TPL of the transmitted pulses selected in a data take. It does not depend on the commanded
parameters SWST and SWL.
The timing is shown in Fig. 5-1.

In a calibration PRI the value CWL will be automatically selected by the Instrument to

CWL TPL CWL _ Delta (in time units)

CWL _ Delta is a Mission Parameter defined in the Instrument Radar Database [IRD 07].

t 9 t 26

t 9 and t 26 are also Mission Parameters defined in the Instrument Radar Database [IRD 07].

With this it follows from Fig. 5-1 :

t guard 2

CWL TPL

It can be seen that

t guard 1

CWL _ Delta t 9 t 26

t guard 2 is always a fixed value as defined by Mission Parameters and independent of the

Tx pulse length.
It has to be noted that the Tx pulse signal will not be sampled at its generation time in the TxM module since
the Tx signal has to propopagate through the Instrument signal pathes (e.g. those of the antenna) before
being received, digitized and processed in the RxM module. For this reason t guard 2 is applied to cover this
signal latency.

The number of captured calibration samples in the Space Packet can be expressed as

1

the figure shows the timing of Tx Pulse generation and Rx Sampling without taking into consideration electronical

roundtrip delays of the Tx pulse via SAS and SES. These may cause a different position of the Tx Pulse signal within the
Space Packet than indicated in the figure. The Instrument timing is adjusted to compensate for these delays.

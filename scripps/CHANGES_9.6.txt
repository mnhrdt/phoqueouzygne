xcorr  - works when the prf of the reference and repeat images is close but does not update the approximate offset as the correlation moves down in azimuth.

esarp - needs to insert zeros in the beginning of the patch buffer when the ashift is negative.

012110
DTS - xcorr changed to account for the different prf's

012510
DTS - xcorr changed to put astretcha in the xcorr struct
DTS - makefile changed to get the -m64 compiler flag from the user's .tcshrc file

020110
DTS - phasediff neede additional code to match old pdiff
DTS - intf.csh needs options for fbd
DTS - 
XT  - working on phasediff.c: check dimensions, run model phase. 

020210
XT  - phasediff.c: finished modelphase and check dimensions. 

020310 
XT  - ALOS_align.csh: removed repeated lines in slave PRM file. (failed) 
    -                 fixed "awk $3" related problems.  

020410 
XT  - changed intf.csh to add in -fbs or -fbd switch. 

020610
DTS - change esarp to properly deal with negative yshifts
DTS - added the offset_topo code but not tested yet

020710
DTS - made minor changes to all the files in csh  also changed
      ALOS_align.csh to align.csh and not SAT is a parameter.

020810
XT  - modify make_dem.csh: it now can deal with South and East hemisphere. 
    -                      changed its option. 
    -                      do bytes swap based on arch. 
    - use rng_samp_rate to identify the FBS mode: include slc2amp.csh, intf.csh, align.csh, dem2topophase.csh.
    - Changed intf.csh to append baseline parameters into slave PRM. 
020910
XT  - Changed make_dem.csh and dem2topophase.csh: add plotting. 

021210
RJM - changed spline.c to be independent of f2c.h
DTS - tested spline.c routine

021310
DTS - added grd2kml.csh to shell scripts
DTS - added geocode.csh to shell scripts
DTS - created instructions for processing a single interferogram

021610
TODO - make phasediff immune to PRM-file having multiple definitions of the baseline parameters
TODO - create an overall script to process a single interferogram process2pass.csh
TODO - check and revise makefiles on a LINUX computer
TODO - test all the cfft1d_custom routines
 
021610 
XT   - made process2pass.csh, works for ALOS only right now.  

022710
DTS  - fixed xcorr to not use data in near and far range where amplitudes are low
DTS  - made a lot of minor changes to the c-shells to make better plots and filter the correlation
DTS  - removed all the system dependent complex.h stuff from SLOS_preproc - many changes - beware of bugs

030610
DTS - bugs identified from the student exercises:
DTS - psraster transparency does not work - look into setting the background
DTS - mixed-mode interferometry is not automatic yet
DTS - ALOS_fbs2fbd has a memory problem on speedychef - try calling the cfft1d with the longer nfft first just to allocate the static memory
DTS - the very long baseline Hawaii pair shows 5 residual fringes when the elevation change is 4000 m - investigate - could be an error in topo2phase
DTS - makedem.csh has a bug for southern hemisphere - replace the "-" by an "s"
DTS - get snafu to work with gmtsar

030810
Robert Petersen reports on using snafu - check e-mail

031010
DTS  - placed setenv clobber in all *.csh files to override a possible user's noclobber
DTS  - changes the 'arch' command in the make files and csh file with the more standard 'uname -p'
DTS  - changed the makecpt -Ccyclic to the more standard -Crainbow

031110
DTS  - changed fitoffset.csh default SNR from 35 to 30.
DTS  - tested pre_proc.csh to make all images in a stack into FBS mode
DTS  - changes align.csh to use already preprocessed data
DTS  - changed process2pass.csh to use the new pre_proc.csh and align.csh

DTS - fix to the VDSP stuff - add the prefix vDSP_ to the front of the subroutine names
      this fixes the linking problem and also the memory problem in ALOS_fbd2fbs
      on mgg2 running ALOS_fbd2fbs, the fftpack takes 193 sec whild the veclib takes 162 sec
      there is more of a speed increase for esarp

031210
DTS - added the GNU license information
DTS - changed position of computation of chirp_ext in ALOS_pre_process so the num_rng_bins was correct for FBD

031310
DTS - the program ALOS_fbs2fbd changes the pulse_dur by a factor of 1/2.  This reduces the pulse length by 216 points.  This causes a shift of 108 points in the focussed SLC. Doubling the pulse_dur makes a nonsence result with ghost image in the range direction.  ALOS_fbs2fbd is an unreliable program that should not be used.   One should always increase the resolution of the FBD rather than decrease the resolution of the FBS.

031410
XT  - changed setenv clobber unsetenv noclobber
DTS - added a range shift  of 108*dr to output from ALOSfbs2fbda.  this fixes the alignment issue

031510
DTS - tested the process2pass.csh and pre_proc.csh by not forcing the dopper to be zero.  
      Case 1 - I let the Doppler be the best Doppler for the master - this seems to work

031610
DTS - Changes the ALOS_pre_proc code to make all fbd data have num_rng_bins = 5652

032310
DTS - We need to change the interface to all shell scripts and codes to accept the IMG-filename with or without the .PRM suffix.
      We need to make the code more robust grd2xyz | ALOS_llt2rat have memory problems on some machines.
      We need to add an unwrap interface to Snaphu, downsample the phase and test.
      We need to add a man page for each module with some details.
      We need to improve cleanup.csh to target the removal of specific files in topo.
      We need to change the proj_ra2ll program to recognize when the projection grd-files are available and not recompute them.

032510
DTS - Using XT's base script added snaphu.csh to perform phase unwrapping
DTS - Changed proj_ra2ll.csh to recognize when the projection grids are available.
DTS - Changed all the input parameters to have more consistent names and usage.
DTS - Need to make process2pass work with mixed mode interferograms.

033110
XT - slightly changed snaphu.csh and geocode.csh 
     let geocode.csh run without error message if snaphu.csh fails. 
040510
XT - working on the pre_proc.csh and process2pass.csh: 
     1. make process2pass.csh work with mixed mode interferograms.
     2. use configuration file as input to process2pass.csh to add in flexibility. (unfinished)
040610
XT - split the pre_proc.csh into two:
     pre_proc.csh take command line arguments to pre_process two images at a time. 
     pre_proc_batch.csh process a list of image files and generate baseline table. It can be used to select optimal baseline pair. 

XT - modify the process2pass.csh to process2pass_config.csh to add in more features, including: 
     1 use a configuration file.
     2 let user to define a stage number, which allow part of the processing, so one can start from the intermediate stage if made a mistake in one of the stages.
     3 distinguish between master/slave with reference/repeat. 
     4 enable make_dem.csh while allow user to input DEM independently. 
     5 allow user to define more parameters.   

050410
MW - Modified align.csh dem2topophase.csh intf.csh for ENVISAT. intf.csh not done yet. Made process2pass_envi.csh

051810
DTS - made a number of minor chabges to the C-shepp scripts.  
      grd2kml.csh more accurate DPI
      filter.csh - has only filter2 as an option 
      snaphu.csh - added option to restrict area for unwrapping
      gmtsar.csh - lists the names of all the C-shells

062510
RJM - rewrote xcorr to properly deal with the fractional part of the offset
      Here are the results of test comparisons with the old offset.f program

The test was
1) focus two ALOS FBS data
2) run ALOS_baseline to get a guess at the offset
3) run offset.dat > fitoffset.csh
4) run xcorr2 > fitoffset.csh
5) refocus the second image using the scorr2 parameters
6) run offset.dat > fitoffset.csh
7) run xcorr2 > fitoffset.csh

match two ALOS SLC's
prog       rshift     ashift    rstretch    astretch
offset     -86.38     37.58     -.000769    .000578
xcorr      -86.39     37.58     -.000762    .000574
refocus the second SLC using the xcorr parameters and rematch
prog       rshift     ashift    rstretch    astretch
offset     .0527      -.0244   -7.35337e-06 7.55686e-06
xcorr      -.001      -.0001    1.19416e-06 3.55643e-09

081010
DTS - commented out the phase gradient calculation in filter.csh
      changed the /bin/csh to /bin/csh -f so the scripts will reun under REDHAT LINUX for Lydie Sichoix

090110
XT  - added three new C-shell scripts to prepare stacks of aligned SLCs and interferograms

092210
DTS - tested the batch shell scripts and fixed a minor problem with the SLC_file missing from the master.

092510
DTS - rough draft documentation added to code

092910
DTS - removed all the uname -m from the makefiles and define $OS in the gmtsar_config

100410
DTS - changed memory allocation in xcorr to fix bug detected by Scott Arko using 64 but UBUNTU.

102610
DTS - rewrote part of phasediff to use full non-linear terms in topographic phase correction.
      because of this change the program is no longer needed and was deleted from the distribution.
      Appendic C of documentation was updated to include the relevant equations for the topographic
      phase correction.

111510 
XT  - rewrite phase2topo to read/write grd file format and add it to src/
      this phase2topo can be used to generate/correct DEM

112710
XT  - rewrite ihBperp to read/write grd file format. Call it bperp now. 

123010
MW  - Wrote perl scripts to extract Envisat and ERS orbital information from the Doris 
      and PRC files, respectively.

DTS - Re-wrote the ERS preprocessor codes to work on a little endian machine.
      Tested p2pERS.csh and p2pENVI.csh and compiled example data sets.

010211
DTS - Proposed changes:
      1) Change baseline model from two end ponts of B and alpha (4 parameters) to
         a 6-parameter model. Bh Bv Bh_dot Bv_dot Bh_dd, Bv_dd.  This would reduce seams
         at overlapping frame boundaries and provide better accuracy for long swaths.
      2) Change the envisat decode program and the ers_line_fixer program to read near_range
         instead of swst and output the closest near range.  When no near_range is specified
         the code would use the near_range of the first line of the raw data file.
      3) Similarly change the ENVI and ERS codes so the earth_radius can be specified and the orbit
         programs would output the corresponding spacecraft heights.
      4) Add a parameter to the config.txt to set the Doppler to a prescribed value e.g., dopler = 55.5
      5) Change p2p_ENVI.csh and p2p_ERS.csh to operate in the same way as p2p_ALOS.csh
      6) Make or modify the batch scripts so they work with ERS and ENVISAT

021711
XT -  Change the envisat decode program and the ers_line_fixer program to read near_range
      instead of swst and output the closest near range.  When no near_range is specified
      the code would use the near_range of the first line of the raw data file.

XT -  Similarly change the ENVI and ERS codes so the earth_radius can be specified and the orbit
      programs would output the corresponding spacecraft heights.

XT -  Change p2p_ENVI.csh and p2p_ERS.csh to operate in the same way as p2p_ALOS.csh

022711
DTS - Rewrote aastretch.c and esarp.c to use a spline interpolation in azimuth rather than a linear interpolation.
      This increases the coherence slightly but also removes the 32-bit bug found by Sven and Piyush.

041111
XT  - Fix a bug in proj_ll2ra.csh. Previously the boundary of the grd file was not transformed correctly and the spatial averaging was too big. 

041711
DTS - added code to read_ALOS_data.c to skip over missing lines rather than terminate

041711
DTS - changes baselline model from linear to quadratic.  This required changes to the 
PRM structure and lots of other changes.

043011
DTS - increased length of file name strings in conv from 64 to 128 to handle the long envisat filenames
      add some name checking to ERS_pre_process and ENVI_pre_process

071511
DTS - memory leak fixed in ALOS_fbd2fbs.  Problem occurred in non-mac unix machines.

080411
XT  - added an option in xcorr to read real (float) data. This can be used to do cross-correlation on image files (e.g. Geotiff files).

090211 
XT - revised ERS_pre_process and ENVI_pre_process to have an option to speficify the num_patches. 
    - debugged ers_line_fixer: previously the code didn't align lines if using default near_range value.  

092911
XT - added/edited some shell scripts to do stacking automatically: batch.csh intf_batch.csh landmask.csh 
     pre_proc_batch.csh pre_proc_init.csh proj_model.csh 
     snaphu.csh stack.csh stack_phase.bash stack_corr.bash std.bash uwm.bash

020212
DTS - These new scripts from the last entry were not exported until 2/2/12.

051412 
XT  - Take the ALOS_fbs2fbd out. User must use the FBS mode image as master.  

070212
XT and DTS - Fixed bug in ALOS_baseline for the case where the alpha at the start of the frame and 
             the alpha at the end of the frame spanned the angle of 90 degrees.  
             This caused an interferogram with a high fringe rate in azimuth.

081012
DTS        - Made Envisat patch size to 2800 so more of raw data is used.  Increased the length of the
             search in ALOS_baseline, and ERS/ENVI_baseline to allow for raw data files of very different lengths.
             Decreased the distance between labels on the y-axis of the baseline plot from 1000 m to 200 m.

030113
DTS	   - Ben Thompson found a bug in phasefilt where an array index was outside of its memory allocation.
             This caused a segment violation on Ubuntu UNIX.

032113
DTS        - Added the capability to pre-process ALOS L1.1 SLC files.  This is being done in preparation
             for ALOS-2 where only SLC's will be delivered.   There is a new program ALOS_pre_process_SLC
             that reads the L1.1 IMG and LED files and makes PRM and SLC files.  The geolocation accuracy
             of these reformatted data was tested using the corner reflectors at Pinon.

040313
DTS        - Added a reasmp program to resample SLC files.  Not fully tested yet.  Also fixed a warning 
	     rmpatch.c:79: warning: passing argument 2 of ‘intp_coef’ from incompatible pointer type.  This 
	     was changed to intp_coef(nfilter, xintp); from intp_coef(nfilter, &xintp);
040513
DTS        - Removed some ALOS code from the gmtsar/include area. Changed a parameter in the ERS offset topo from 111 to 11.
             The 111 caused the code to be VERY slow.

041213
DTS        - Changed makefile so they will link with the new shared netcdf and GMT libraries.

041713     - Changed snaphu.csh to work with gmt5.

052413     - Changed locations for all executables.  Also tested on Fedora and Ubuntu UNIX

060313     - Changed ers_line_fixer to deal with data with incorrect pri_dn value hard wired to 2820

060413     - Changed ers_line_fixer to deal with larger data gaps.  Also changes esarp to deal with 
             incorrect line length information in the 412-byte raw data headewrs.

061213     - Changed snaphu.csh to work with water mask and added option to unwrap a sub area.

070213     - Changed geocode.csh to compute detrended LOS displacement in mm

070813     - changed many of the scripts to clean things up: batch.config gmtsar.csh grd2kml.csh p2p_ALOS.csh
XT           p2p_ENVI.csh p2p_ERS.csh proj_model.csh snaphu.csh stack.csh stack_corr.csh stack_phase.bash

100913	   - changed the ALOS_pre_process_SLC to fix a number of incorrect parameters

112013     - wrote ALOS_fbd2fbs_SLC and p2p_ALOS_SLC.csh to process ALOS L1.1 data in mixed FBD and FBS modes.
EX (Eric Xu)

010614     
XT         - changed codes in gmtsar/lib_src and ALOS_preproc/lib_src and sarp.csh and virgin.PRM to add a new parameter "dfact" to the PRM file.

011114	   - started making changes needed for TSX including updates to dem2topo_ra.csh	filter.csh intf.csh and resamp.c to work with larger files.
             also added comments in the headers of the shell scripts. 

012714     - Fixed a bug in xcorr.c that only appeared when the master and slave images had a different number of 
             complex numbers in the range direction.  Basically the offset used to gather the chip of data in the
             slave file was based on the number of range samples in the master image.  The code was built to do this
             offset properly but there were typos in two of the lines.

012714     - Added support for CSK raw data

021714     - Added support for RS2 SLC data

021914     - made generic calc_dop_orb, SAT_baseline, SAT_llt2rat, SAT_look and p2p_SAT_SLC.csh.
             changed dem2topo_ra.csh to decide on decimation based on range sampling rate.

022414     - added a defomax parameter to the snaphu unwrapping to enable phase jumps

022414     - added scales to unwrapped phase and LOS

062214     -  DTS - changes ALOS_pre_process_SLC to work with ALOS-2 data

072414     -  XT and DTS - changed parameters in TSX processing - added sbas capability

072714     -  DTS and XT - updated the dem generation for TXS to downsample in range by 2 instead of 4
                           added three new spatial filters for TSX
	                   added time series capability for SBAS (Mac only)
                           removed unused variabiles from all codes

082014	   -  DTS	-  changes the file trans.dat from ascii to double precision floats

091914     -  XT        -  changes to the SBAS code. allocate memory with 1D array instead of multiple malloc, 
                           do not require the velocity curve go through origin,
                           remove seasonal term  
                           fix temporal smoothing 
                           It can be compiled in both mac and linux. A separate makefile is attached for each system. 
092714	   - XU and DTS -  Addes Sentinel-1A preprocessor capability

092914     - DTS        -  Added all preprocessors to s single subdirectory called preproc.  This includes
                           ERS ENVISAT ALOS- Radarsat-2 Terrasar-X Cosmos-SkyMed  Sentinel- and ALOS-2

101514     - DTS        -  completed and tested the InSAR code for ALOS2 L1.1 CEOS
                           needed to add 132 bytes to the prefix offset for ALOS-2 but not ALOS-1

102019     - DTS        -  set all the Dopplers zero for ALOS-2

112014     - DTS        - fixed a bug in ALOS_llt2rat and SAT_llt2rat to improve convergence of algorithm in pathological cases.

112214     - EX         - added new chs5 scripts to process data using GMT5

112514     - DTS        - fixed array dimension bug in SAT_look and ALOS_look.  Also reduced the end time of the search area.

123014     - DTS        - change makefile in library areas to simplify and work with Debian LINUX

123114     - DTS        - fixed most of the warnings especially in the preprocessors

011315     - DTS        - fixed the makefile for CSK_RAW, fixed bug related to switch_master, tested csh5 code

030415     - XU and DTS - added a module to extend the number of state vectors in an LED file. 

030715	   - XU and DTS - made minor changes to extend_orbit as well as SAT_baseline

032715     - DTS        - modified the S1A reader to remove the extra space between bursts for the TOPS mode.

040415     - DTS        - fixed a near-range bug in the ENVI preprocessor and some minor timing issues.

040715     - DTS        - changed SAT_baseline programs to use ashift in baseline and height calculations

041615     - DTS        - modified fitoffset.csh to solve for only 5 parameters (a_stretch_a = 0). have a
                          special fitoffset_6.csh for satellites with long baselines (e.g., ALOS-1)

042415     - DTS        - modified fitoffset to solve for only 4 parameters.  The 5 and 6-parameter
                          versions are still available at fitoffset_5.csh and fitoffset_6.csh

050615     - DTS        - modified the fitoffset again so 4 parameters are used for all the C-band SLC data,
                          5 parameters are used for the ALOS SLC data and 6 parameters are used for the raw data.

070215     - XT         - modified intf_batch.csh p2p_ALOS_SLC.csh and p2p_ALOS2_SLC.csh  to use the landmask 
                          prior to phase unwrapping.  

072215     - DTS        - replaced the many fisoffset_N.csh with a single script that does 2 - 6 parameters.  
                          modified make_s1a_slc to fix a minor bug with the TOPS pre-processing.

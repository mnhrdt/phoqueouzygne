the old phase2topo from siosar is accurate but it assumes alpha = 0, 
which is not suitable for DEM error recovery after stacking. 

the linear correction of phase2topo is suitable for DEM 
error recovery after stacking and is good enough from my 
calculations because the starting SRTM DEM is quite accurate. 

I will use this linear relationship between residual phase and topo error.

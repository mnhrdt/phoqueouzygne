MAC INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1) Install mac ports and update
https://www.macports.org/install.php

sudo port selfupdate
sudo port upgrade outdated

2) Install gmt4 which includes gdal curl geos hdf5 netcdf

sudo port install gdal +curl +geos +hdf5 +netcdf
sudo port install gmt4

3) Install packages for newer preprocessors TSX, CSK, S1A, RADARSAT-2

sudo port install boost
sudo port install libgeotiff

4) Install GMTSAR.  The source code is at:

http://topex.ucsd.edu/gmtsar/downloads

Unpack the tar file into a location where you will want to install the code.  
A good location is /usr/local.

5) Download orbit files for ERS and ENVISAT. No need for ALOS orbit data because it is built in raw file.

http://topex.ucsd.edu/gmtsar/downloads

The file is > 1G and contains all the available orbit for ERS and ENVISAT. It takes a while to download but you only need to download it once. Put it anywhere you like.

6) Edit the file GMTSAR/gmtsar_config and set the path to gmt, netcdf, gmtsar, and orbit files.  Run the source command to activate these paths.  You should set the M64 parameter to the appropriate value for your GMT installation or just leave it blank. Uncomment the lines related to link of the routine cfft1d.c

  source /usr/local/GMTSAR/gmtsar_config

Also add this source command to the end of your .cshrc (or .tcshrc) file.

Note for users whoes default shell is bash:
To compile:
cd /usr/local/GMTSAR - or wherever your GMTSAR is located.
csh - this activates the C-shell
source /usr/local/GMTSAR/gmtsar_config

For partial installation type
make

For the complete installation with all preprocessors type
make -f Makefile_all_preproc

To run:
csh
source /usr/local/GMTSAR/gmtsar_config  - 

5) Go to the install directory and type.  (This will only work with csh or tcsh as your default shell.)

   make  

This should make two sets of code ALOS_preproc, ERS_preproc, ENVISAT_preproc, and GMTSAR. If everything seems OK type rehash and try a couple of the commands such as xcorr or  align.csh.

6) test the commands: grdinfo esarp, xcorr, conv, gmtsar.csh . . . 
If this does not work then start a new window and try again.  Make sure the command source /usr/local/GMTSAR/gmtsar_config is in your .tcshrc file.

*****************************************************************************************************
RUN

1) GET DATA. There is an example data set at our website where you found gmtsar.

http://topex.ucsd.edu/gmtsar/downloads/

Uncompress the file and then unpack with tar.

2) ORGANIZE the DISK. The standard GMTSAR run has the following directories. 

  raw 	SLC 	topo   intf

raw - contains the original data.  

SLC - contains the single look complex images derived from the raw data.

topo - contains a digital elevation model for the area in geographic and ultimately radar coordinates.

intf - contains subdirectories with the possible interferograms (only 1 for this example).

In raw, orginal data have special name format. If you got data that have different name system, you need to change the name according to the following:
 
For ALOS we just need the IMG- and LED-files.  Here is an example.
-rw-r--r--  1 sandwell  14  382547520 Aug 28 15:29 IMG-HH-ALPSRP227730640-H1.0__A
-rw-r--r--  1 sandwell  14   12506972 Aug 28 15:28 LED-ALPSRP227730640-H1.0__A
-rw-r--r--  1 sandwell  14   12506972 Aug 28 15:28 LED-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A
-rw-r--r--  1 sandwell  14  747383820 Aug 28 15:28 IMG-HH-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A

Make sure the images are all from the same orbit direction, same track, and same frame.  The filename 
ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A  can be decomposed as:

__A - ascending
0640 - frame number
20760 - orbit number   To check that the data are from the same track, the difference between orbit numbers should be divisible by 671.   In this case there are 7,  46-day cycles between the acquisitions.

For ENVISAT we just need .baq file. Here is an example.
ENV1_2_084_2943_42222.baq
ENV1_2_084_2943_42723.baq

The filename means:
ENVISAT _ 2 _ track number _ frame number _ orbit number

For ERS we just need .dat and .ldr file. Here is an example.
e2_127_2907_23027.ldr
e2_127_2907_23027.dat
e2_127_2907_23528.ldr
e2_127_2907_23528.dat

The filename means:
ERS2_track number_frame number_orbit number.
.dat - raw data file
.ldr - leader file

3) MAKE DEM 

Go to the following web site and construct a file dem.grd that encloses the SAR frame.
http://topex.ucsd.edu/gmtsar/demgen

Place the file dem.grd in the /topo directory. 

4) DO EVERYTHING

For ALOS:
p2p_ALOS.csh IMG-HH-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A IMG-HH-ALPSRP227730640-H1.0__A configure.txt

The file configure.txt should be edited to set a number of parameters including the starting point for t
he InSAR processing.

For ENVISAT:
p2p_ENVI.csh ENV1_2_084_2943_42222 ENV1_2_084_2943_42723 dem.grd

For ERS:
p2p_ERS.csh e2_127_2907_23027 e2_127_2907_23528 dem.grd

*********************************************************************************************************

RUN - STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

Taking ALOS for example but applicable to ERS and ENVISAT.

1) PREPROCESS the raw data

    cd raw
    ls IMG* >> data.in

Edit the data.in file and place the master in the first line. 
Also one can set the -radius and -near_range on the first line to have this frame match other frames along the same track.  When this command is done you will have PRM and raw files for every scene in the list data.in, all in the same format and geometry. Execute the command.

   pre_proc_batch.csh ALOS data.in

2) ALIGN the SLC images.  Link the raw data into the SLC directory.
    cd SLC
    cp ../raw/*.PRM .
    ln -s ../raw/*.raw .
    ln -s ../raw/LED* .

Align the images
   
    align.csh ALOS IMG-HH-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A IMG-HH-ALPSRP227730640-H1.0__A 

This will keep your computer busy for a while.  The first image is called the master and the second is a slave.  One can align a slave to the master and then use that slave as a surrogate master.  This is useful for alignment of a large stack of data having a large spread in the baseline versus time plot.  When this is done you will have 2 output files for each scene, a PRM-file and a Single Look Complex (SLC-file).   The PRM-files are ascii text files containing the parameters needed for InSAR processing.

master
IMG-HH-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A.PRM
IMG-HH-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A.SLC

slave
IMG-HH-ALPSRP227730640-H1.0__A.PRM
IMG-HH-ALPSRP227730640-H1.0__A.SLC

(Look inside the script align.csh to see what it does.)

3) MAKE the topo_ra.grd

   cd topo
   cp ../SLC/IMG-HH-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A.PRM master.PRM
   ln -s ../raw/LED-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A .

Next you will need  a file dem.grd.  Thus can be created at:
http://topex.ucsd.edu/gmtsar/demgen

Once you have the dem.grd in lon/lat coordinates you can convert it to radar coordinates using the following command. 

  dem2topo_ra.csh master.PRM dem.grd

This creates a file called topo_ra.grd.  The script also creates postscript images of the dem.ps and topo_ra.ps that can be viewed.  The script also creates a file trans.dat that has the complete mapping from lon,lat,topo to range,azimuth.  This same file will be used later for geocoding, (i.e., converting the range, azimuth grids back into lon, lat space).

4) INTERFEROGRAM

  cd intf
  mkdir 20760_22773  

Note these are the orbit numbers of the reference and repeat images.  One could also use dates for the directory name. 

   cd 20760_22773
   ln -s ../../raw/LED-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A .
   ln -s ../../raw/LED-ALPSRP227730640-H1.0__A .
   cp ../../SLC/IMG-HH-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A.PRM .
   cp ../../SLC/IMG-HH-ALPSRP227730640-H1.0__A.PRM .
   ln -s ../../SLC/IMG-HH-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A.SLC .
   ln -s ../../SLC/IMG-HH-ALPSRP227730640-H1.0__A.SLC .
   ln -s ../../topo/topo_ra.grd .

All these files are needed to be linked or copied to make the interferogram.  Of course this could all be done with a script. Now make the interferogram.  While it is running look inside the script intf.csh to see the grdmath.  Also of you have any kind of error, delete everything and start over.

  intf.csh IMG-HH-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A.PRM IMG-HH-ALPSRP227730640-H1.0__A.PRM  -topo topo_ra.grd

The output will be three grd  and postscript files.

display_amp.grd, display_amp.ps  - amplitude of interferogram
phase.grd, phase.ps              - phase of interferogram
corr.grd, corr.ps                - correlation of interferogram

The phase measures the displacement of the repeat images relative to the reference images.
The "reference and repeat" is a separate definition from the "master and slave" (refer to the document).
Note that the phase is relative measurement so it's not important whether the pixel values are negative or positive.
Phase increase means that the ground is moving away from the radar (range increasing);
phase decrease means that the ground is moving toward the radar (range decreasing).

5) FILTER INTERFEROGRAM

   filter.csh IMG-HH-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A.PRM IMG-HH-ALPSRP227730640-H1.0__A.PRM gauss_alos_200m 2

 The gaussian filter and decimation for the amplitude and phase images are the same.
 filter is the  name of the filter.
 decimation control the size of the amplitude and phase images. It is either 1 or 2.
 Set the decimation to be 1 if you want higher resolution images.
 Set the decimation to be 2 if you want images with smaller file size.

The output will be masked and filtered phase as well as phase gradients (xphase.grd and yphase.grd).

6) UNWRAP PHASE

   cd intf/20760_22773
   shaphu.csh .10  

7) GEOCODE

   cd intf/20760_22773
   ln -s ../../topo/trans.dat .
   geocode.csh .10

This command will make postscript and KML images of the phase, correlation, and display amplitude.  The argument 0.15 is used to mask the phase when the coherence is less than 0.15.  Use your GMT skills to improve on these maps.  One can combine the phase (color) and amplitude (shading) in grdimage or combine the phase (color) and grdgradient dem.grd (shading) to make interesting plots.

8) SHIFT THE TOPOPHASE [OPTIONAL]

The topo_ra.grd may not be perfectly aligned with the master SLC. This can be corrected by shifting the topo_ra by 1 or 2 pixels, usually in the range direction.  

   cd SLC
   slc2amp.csh IMG-HH-ALPSRP207600640-H1.0__A.PRM amp_master.grd
   cd ../topo
   ln -s ../SLC/amp_master.grd .
   offset_topo amp_master.grd topo_ra.grd 0 0 5 topo_shift.grd

The last line of the output from this program shows the shift needed to maximize the cross correlation between the amplitude of the master image and the range gradient of the topo_ra.grd.  The output file is the topography shifted by an integer number of pixels.  Now go back to step 4) and use the topo_ra_shift.grd  instead of the topo_ra.grd to remake the interferogram.
